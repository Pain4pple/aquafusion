# AquaFusion: Smart Fish Feeding System

AquaFusion is a microcontroller-based automated fish feeding system designed as a capstone project. It integrates multiple sensors and actuators to dispense precise food amounts, detect feed flow, and monitor storage levels while offering real-time user feedback via TFT display and SMS alerts. The firmware was written in Embedded C using non-blocking `millis()` logic and a finite state machine for real-time control.

## üîß Features

* **Targeted feeding**: Dispenses food based on HX711 load cell measurements with 96.66% accuracy.
* **Two-gate dispensing system**: Sequential control using PWM-driven servo motors.
* **Feed spinner motor**: DC motor activated via relay logic to ensure consistent feed release.
* **Flow detection**: IR sensor checks for feed flow and flags blockages.
* **Storage monitoring**: Ultrasonic sensor calculates remaining feed level and triggers low-level alerts.
* **SMS Alerts**: GSM module sends notification to predefined phone number upon feeding completion.
* **TFT Display**: Displays real-time target vs actual feed weight.
* **Serial Command Control**: Parses commands like `feed:50`, `send_sms:+1234567890:done`, `spin`, and `calibrate`.
* **Real-time fault handling**: Timeout handling for feeding and GSM operations.

## üéì Key Functional Modules

### State Machine

```cpp
enum State {
  IDLE,
  FEEDING,
  SPIN,
  SMS,
  CALIBRATE_WEIGHT
};
```

* Ensures system remains responsive and transitions smoothly between operational phases using finite state control.

### Serial Command Parsing

Accepts serial commands to operate:

* `feed:50` ‚Äî sets target feed weight and begins feeding cycle
* `send_sms:+1234567890:Feeding done` ‚Äî sends SMS alert
* `spin` ‚Äî manually trigger spinner motor
* `calibrate` ‚Äî reads load cell for recalibration

### Feeding Sequence

1. Tares load cell.
2. Opens servo gate until 90% of target weight is achieved.
3. Starts spinner and ramps for 3 seconds.
4. Verifies feed flow with IR sensor.
5. Opens second gate for final release.
6. Sends SMS confirmation.
7. Displays weight info on TFT screen.
